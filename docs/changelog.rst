v0.10.0
'''''''

- Add the multiple-valued properties ``albumtypes``, ``catalognums`` and
  ``languages``.
- The ``catalognum`` property now refers to additional file tags named

  tags named ``ALBUM_ARTIST`` and ``ALBUM ARTISTS``. (The latter
  is used only for reading.)

  found. The first available tag is used instead, like with other kinds of
  fields.
